This describes the definition of a transaction in ICON, functionalities, and specification. You can get a basic understanding of transaction in ICON from this page.

## Transaction

### Definition

The term “transaction” in ICON refer to the "signed" data package which is used for changing the states of a blockchain (e.g. deploying a SCORE, ICX coin transfer, etc) . A transaction always has to involve signature data.

### Purpose of Signature

- The signature prevents transaction data from forge or falsification. for example, If the transaction data is falsified while propagation, valid signature (i.e. expected valid signature data) data also change. As no one can generate the valid signature except the owner of an account who generates a transaction, this transaction will be failed while verifying a transaction. 
- Signature guarantee that a transaction data has been generated by the owner of an account.

### Function of Transaction

- ICX Coin transfer
- Record message on the blockchain
- Deploy or update SCOREs
- Change SCORE's states

### Specification
The specific information on transaction data, see the JSON-RPC APIs "icx_sendTransaction" section of the [ICON JSON-RPC API v3 Specification](https://github.com/icon-project/documentation/blob/develop/references/json-rpc/icon-json-rpc-v3.md) documentation.

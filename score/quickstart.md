# Quickstart Guide

Intended audience are the developers who are new to ICON, but are familiar with programming languages and have basic SW development experience. The purpose of this guide is to help you setup the SCORE developement environment, and deploy your first SCORE quickly without touching any in-depth knowledge.

This tutorial is in three parts. In part 1, you will get familiar with the developement tools, and the local testing environment. You will write a simple SCORE, and execute it on your PC. In part 2, you will learn how to deploy the SCORE onto the testnet, and write a python client code to interact with it. Part 3 will explain how to set up your own private devnet on AWS.

#### Part 1. [HelloWorld on local emulated environment](quickstart_p1.md)

- Install T-Bears (Docker)
- Test account
- Check your account balance
- Create HelloWorld contract and deploy it
- Modify HelloWorld contract to greet you

#### Part 2. [HelloWorld on testnet](quickstart_p2.md)

- Configure ICONex to connect to the testnet
- Create an account in ICONex
- Get test ICX
- Transaction fees
- Configure T-Bears to see the testnet
- Deploy HelloWorld to the testnet (T-Bears CLI)
- Execute HelloWorld (T-Bears CLI, Python)

#### Part 3. Private devnet on AWS

- TBD
